I’ve always felt there was a space missing in the market - pieces that blend South Asian artistry with a contemporary, elevated aesthetic. I wanted clothing that felt exclusive, intentional, and made with real soul.\n\nEvery piece is produced in limited quantities, hand-embellished details, and silhouettes designed to feel both effortless and luxurious. Nothing is mass-produced and nothing is restocked - each design is created to be treasured. Sana Khan Luxe is my story stitched into every garment: a fusion of heritage, modernity, and the belief that luxury should always feel deeply personal.","video":"shopify:\/\/files\/videos\/sana-khan-interview (1).mp4","thumbnail":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/video-thumbnail.jpg"}}},"order":["main","our_story_video_Fe7CYt"]}
